    "They live in a world of sensational possibilities and are in tune with the way things look, taste, sound, feel, and smell. They have a strong aesthetic appreciation for art, and they are likely to be artists in some form because they are gifted at creating things that affect the senses. they are quiet, reserved, perceptive, and sympathetic individuals with little desire to lead or control others. They usually choose careers where they are given a great deal of autonomy so their natural artistic abilities can operate at their best and allow them to be consistent with their strong core of inner values. ISFPs are natural artists,counselors, and teachers. They rarely enjoy the fast-paced corporate world.ISFPs make up 8.8 percent of the U.S. population.",
