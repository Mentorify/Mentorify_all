## üêõ Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of Mentorify seriously. If you have discovered a security vulnerability, we appreciate your help in disclosing it to us in a responsible manner.

### Where to Report

**Please DO NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via:
- Email: security@mentorify.com (replace with actual email)
- Or create a private security advisory on GitHub

### What to Include

Please include the following information in your report:

1. **Type of vulnerability** (e.g., XSS, SQL injection, authentication bypass)
2. **Full paths of source file(s)** related to the vulnerability
3. **Location of the affected source code** (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
4. **Step-by-step instructions** to reproduce the issue
5. **Proof-of-concept or exploit code** (if possible)
6. **Impact of the issue**, including how an attacker might exploit it

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 5 business days
- **Fix Timeline**: Depends on severity
  - Critical: 1-7 days
  - High: 7-30 days
  - Medium: 30-90 days
  - Low: Best effort

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Never commit sensitive data**
   - No API keys, passwords, or tokens in code
   - Use environment variables
   - Check `.gitignore` is properly configured

2. **Keep dependencies updated**
   ```bash
   npm audit
   npm audit fix
   ```

3. **Use strong authentication**
   - Implement proper JWT token validation
   - Use secure password hashing (bcryptjs)
   - Implement rate limiting

4. **Validate all inputs**
   - Never trust user input
   - Use express-validator
   - Sanitize data before database operations

5. **Follow secure coding practices**
   - Use HTTPS in production
   - Set secure HTTP headers
   - Implement CORS properly
   - Use parameterized queries

### For Deployment

1. **Environment Variables**
   - Use strong, random `SECRET_KEY`
   - Never expose `.env` files
   - Rotate secrets regularly
   - Use different secrets for different environments

2. **Database Security**
   - Use strong database passwords
   - Restrict network access
   - Enable authentication
   - Regular backups
   - Use encryption at rest

3. **Server Security**
   - Keep server software updated
   - Use firewall rules
   - Disable unnecessary services
   - Monitor logs regularly
   - Use HTTPS/SSL certificates

4. **Application Security**
   - Set `NODE_ENV=production`
   - Disable detailed error messages in production
   - Implement rate limiting
   - Use security headers
   - Enable CSRF protection

## üîê Security Features

### Implemented Security Measures

1. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - JWT-based authentication
   - Role-based access control (RBAC)
   - Password hashing with bcryptjs
   - Secure session management

2. **Data Protection**
   - Input validation with express-validator
   - XSS protection
   - SQL injection prevention (using Mongoose)
   - Secure HTTP headers

3. **API Security**
   - CORS configuration
   - Rate limiting (recommended for production)
   - Request size limits
   - Proper error handling

4. **Password Security**
   - Minimum password requirements
   - Password hashing (bcrypt)
   - Password reset functionality
   - Secure password recovery

### Recommended Additional Security Measures

1. **Rate Limiting**
   ```javascript
   const rateLimit = require('express-rate-limit');
   
   const limiter = rateLimit({
     windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
     max: 100 // limit each IP to 100 requests per windowMs
   });
   
   app.use('/api/', limiter);
   ```

2. **Helmet for Security Headers**
   ```javascript
   const helmet = require('helmet');
   app.use(helmet());
   ```

3. **Input Sanitization**
   ```javascript
   const mongoSanitize = require('express-mongo-sanitize');
   app.use(mongoSanitize());
   ```

4. **Enable 2FA** (Future enhancement)

## üö® Known Security Considerations

### Current Limitations

1. **Rate Limiting**: Not implemented by default - should be added for production
2. **2FA**: Not currently available
3. **Account Lockout**: Not implemented after failed login attempts
4. **Security Headers**: Basic implementation - consider using Helmet
5. **Content Security Policy**: Not fully configured

### Mitigation Recommendations

1. **Implement rate limiting** before production deployment
2. **Add Helmet.js** for enhanced security headers
3. **Set up monitoring** for suspicious activities
4. **Implement account lockout** after multiple failed attempts
5. **Regular security audits** with `npm audit`
